## Overview
FLUX offers a suite of models for tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, in/out-painting, and structural conditioning. With support for both local and API-driven workflows, our repository is designed to help you generate and edit images seamlessly.

## Installation

### Local Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux
cd $HOME/flux
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all]"



Installation with TensorRT Support
For enhanced performance using TensorRT, follow these steps to use an NVIDIA PyTorch image:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux

# Import the NVIDIA PyTorch image (replace $oauthtoken with your token)
enroot import 'docker://$oauthtoken@nvcr.io#nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3'
enroot create -n pti2501 nvidia+pytorch+25.01-py3.sqsh
enroot start --rw -m ${PWD}/flux:/workspace/flux -r pti2501

cd flux
pip install -e ".[tensorrt]" --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

API Usage
Access our models programmatically through our API. First, register at api.bfl.ml to obtain your API key. Then, either set the environment variable:

bash
Copy
Edit
export BFL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>
or pass the API key directly in your calls.

Python Interface
Here's an example of how to generate an image using Python:

python
Copy
Edit
from flux.api import ImageRequest

# Create an API request (non-blocking)
request = ImageRequest("A beautiful beach", name="flux.1.1-pro")
# Alternatively, you can provide the API key directly:
# request = ImageRequest("A beautiful beach", name="flux.1.1-pro", api_key="your_key_here")

# The following will block until the image generation is complete:
image_url = request.url        # Retrieve the URL of the generated image
image_bytes = request.bytes    # Get the raw image bytes
request.save("outputs/api.jpg")  # Save the image locally
image_pil = request.image      # Get a PIL image object
Command Line Interface
Generate images directly from the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Retrieve the URL of the generated image
python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" url

# Generate the image and save it locally
python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" save outputs/api

# Display the generated image directly
python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" image show
